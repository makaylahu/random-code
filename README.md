Just random stuff to get used to GitHub. Also, to practice coding and do random personal projects.

The first project I want to do is to code a Rubik's Cube, which I want to write in Java. This project works by keeping track of each face and its relations to others. I still need to figure out the specifics.
Maybe after finishing this project, try writing it in c++?
