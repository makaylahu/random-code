Just random stuff to get used to GitHub. Also, to practice coding and do random personal projects.

**Rubik's Cube**: Java. This project works by keeping track of each face and its relations to others. I still need to figure out the specifics.
Maybe after finishing this project, try writing it in c++? sike, like this ever happened...

**Word Search**: like it sounds, it's a word search. Mainly uses Java. You can generate a unique 10x10 word search board with 10-13 words with 4-10 letters. The words are pulled off a list of 10000 words provided by MIT: https://www.mit.edu/~ecprice/wordlist.10000
